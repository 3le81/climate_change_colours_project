# Warming Planet: Visualising Climate Change Data with Python (1880-2022)

This project was developed during a workshop presented by Codebar on climate change data visualization with Python [codebar festival](https://festival.codebar.io/) (March 2024, UK)

This repository contains a Python script for visualizing climate change data sourced from NASA. The script generates a simple pattern of red and blue stripes, representing temperature changes from 1880 to 2022. Dark blues indicate colder years, while dark reds represent warmer years.

## Introduction

Data visualization plays a crucial role in understanding complex phenomena like climate change. This project demonstrates how Python can be used to visualize climate change data, enabling us to observe temperature trends over time.

## Features

- **Simple Striped Pattern Visualization**: Generate a pattern of red and blue stripes representing temperature changes over time.
- **Customizable Plot Settings**: Adjust the figure size, aspect ratio, and color scheme to suit your preferences.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.x)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Open a terminal or command prompt and change to the directory where the code is located.

   ```bash
   cd your_repository
   ```

3. **Run the Script**: Execute the Python script to generate the climate change visualization.

   ```bash
   python visualization.py
   ```

   This will generate the visualization, depicting temperature changes from 1880 to 2022, and display it.

## Result

Here's the resulting visualization generated by the Python script:

## Customization

You can customize various aspects of the plot by modifying the Python script. Here are some options you can consider:

- **Adjusting the figure size and aspect ratio**.
- **Changing the color scheme of the stripes based on temperature data**.
- **Adding labels, titles, and legends to the plot for better understanding**.

## Thanks

Special thanks to [codebar](https://codebar.io/) for organizing the workshop "Warming Planet: Visualising Climate Change Data with Python (1880-2022)". The climate change data used in this project is sourced from NASA.
